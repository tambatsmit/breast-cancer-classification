Tumor Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a predictive model to classify tumors as benign or malignant, supporting early detection and clinical decision-making.

Key Highlights:

Data Preprocessing & Balancing: Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance and improve minority class detection.

Models Implemented: Random Forest and AdaBoost, with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Performance: Achieved 95% recall with AdaBoost, ensuring high sensitivity for identifying malignant tumors.

Evaluation Metrics: Recall, Precision, Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and Confusion Matrix for comprehensive evaluation.

Impact: High recall makes the model particularly effective for medical use cases where missing malignant cases can have severe consequences.
